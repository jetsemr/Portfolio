[Kansas City, MO] After graduating from the University of Kansas, my roommates and I spent one month traveling together in Japan and South Korea. We slept in airport terminals, stayed at budget Airbnbs, and became professional tourists. Quickly, the convenience store became our routine before a museum, hiking, or a night out.

The journey from Lawrence, Kansas to Seoul, South Korea takes 40 hours, especially if you decide to sleep in LAX on the way. If you are thinking about weathering an egregious layover to save a few bucks… sleep is more valuable.

Below I've listed my favorite experiences and recommendations. The mega cities are fun, but the best part of East Asia is the food and nature. If you're looking for the path less traveled, put Yakushima and Jeju on your itinerary.

### Seoul [June 6 to June 14]

Seoul is wedged between mountains providing beautiful scenery mixed with the mega city experience. My group stayed by Seoul Station and used public transit.

1. **Korean Barbeque** – Donui Dong is an area lined with BBQ spots. Another restaurant at １−１４ Euljiro 6(yuk)-ga, Jung District, Seoul, South Korea is legit, but harder to find. 
2. **Inwangsan Mountain** – Amazing hike with a panoramic view of the city.
3. **DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ)** – If you are a Wikipedia nerd like me, you will enjoy the visit. There is nothing like being able to see North Korea.
4. **Kwangjang Market** – This was my favorite market. You can find any Korean staple and are right next to a river walk.

### Jeju [June 14 to June 17]

Jeju is an island off the southern coast of Korea. We stayed in Seogwipo and traveled the island by taxi. Make sure to try Hallabong juice and black pork.

1. **Udo** – Take the ferry for a daytrip to this small island with a lighthouse. The views, food, and hikes combine seaside island vibes with a rural experience.
2. **Seongsan Ilchulbong** – UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site. Hike up a volcanic crater at sunset and see expansive views of the ocean.
3. **Hallasan National Park** – Good spot for hiking and is the highest mountain in South Korea.

### Busan [June 17 to June 20]

Busan is my favorite city in South Korea. I ate an octopus that was still moving. Go to the fish market, but be ready to question your morals and values after.

1. **Corn Dogs and Beaches** – We stayed in a condo on the beach and became regulars at the corn dog stand. Water is cold, but really nice on a hot day.
2. **Haedong Yonggungsa Temple** – Old temple with great picture opportunities.
3. **Busan Fish Market** – Huge market where you can order fresh fish. I have seen nothing comparable in the West.

### Yakushima [June 20 to June 23]

Yakushima Island is the most remote location I have traveled to. The airport operates four daily flights and is located in the middle of the rainforest. Our hike through the jungle had me questioning whether I was in Japan or Jurassic Park. We stayed in an Airbnb and rented a car.

1. **Drum Rock (Taiko-iwa)** – Hike through the dense rainforest. My group got caught out in heavy rain, but still had an unforgettable time.
2. **Flying Fish** – Good local delicacy.
3. **Hot Springs** – Find an onsen and relax. At night, the island is so dark you can get an amazing view of the stars.

### Kyoto [June 23 to June 29]

Super old temples, go check them out. Make sure to take day trips to surrounding cities to visit their old temples and shrines.

1. **Kinka-kuji** – Gold temple with surrounding gardens.
2. **Kiyomizu-dera** – UNESCO World Heritage temple with a large great hall.
3. **Nara Park** – Outdoor park with small deer. Go to Susuruka Ramen for delicious ramen covered with flame-broiled cheese.
4. **Osaka** – Go see the running man and eat takoyaki (fried squid balls).

### Tokyo [June 29 to July 6]

This trip was my second time visiting Tokyo, and I still feel like I am not close to visiting every part of the city. I'm just here for Karaoke. My favorite way to eat in Tokyo is to just roam and find local holes in the wall.

1. **Omakase** – The best sushi experience. You can find these restaurants all over the city.
2. **Bullet Trains** – Personally one of my favorite experiences in the world. I took the train from Kyoto to Tokyo. 
3. **Shibuya Scramble** – Famous spot to grab pictures and experience chaos.
4. **Shinjuku National Garden** – Beautiful garden full of cherry trees, ponds, and flowers.
