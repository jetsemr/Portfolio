[Kansas City, MO] After graduating from the University of Kansas in 2023, my college roommates and I spent one month traveling together in Japan and South Korea. We celebrated the past four years before a send off to a new chapter in our lives. Our travels were defined by unforgiving chairs in budget airline terminals, AirBnbs that met bare minimums for accommodations, conversations over absurd hypotheticals, unpredictable roaming, Yi Sun-sin war stories, and too much time spent in convenience stores.

TLDR: Went to Asia, did some things and had fun. Order of the trip: Seoul, Jeju, Busan, Yakushima, Kyoto, Tokyo.

In total the trek from Lawrence, Kansas to Seoul, South Korea took 40 hours. An old Korean man who I met on the internet and didn't speak English was waiting for us outside the airport and drove us to our first AirBnB that would be our home for the next week.

**Seoul** [June 6 to June 14]

Our experience in South Korea was guided by Jimin Park (from South Carolina not BTS). Seoul is wedged between mountains and offers a sprawling big city experience.

4\. Hanboks

**Jeju** [June 14 to June 17]

Why ride a roller coaster when you can just hail a cab on Jeju island? Hallabong juice and Baskin Robbins are the go to local delicacies.

2\. Seongsan Ilchulbong

3\. Hallasan National Park

4\. Osulloc Tea

5\. Black Pork

**Busan** [June 17 to June 20]

I ate an octopus that was still moving. Go to the fish market, but be ready to question your life decisions after.

1\. Corn Dogs and Beaches

2\. Haedong Yonggungsa Temple

3\. Busan Fish Market

**Yakushima** [June 20 to June 23]

Descending in a prop plane into the Yakushima rainforest had me questioning whether I was in Japan or Jurassic Park. During our hike we endured buckets of water being dumped on our heads for hours at a time. It was worth it for the views.

1\. Drum Rock (Taiko-iwa)

2\. Hiking with Yakushima Macaques

**Kyoto** [June 23 to June 29]

Super old temples, go check them out. Make sure to take day trips to surrounding cities to go visit their old temples and shrines.

1\. Kinka-kuji

2\. Kiyomizu-dera

3\. Nara Park

4\. Osaka

**Tokyo** [June 29 to July 6]

This was my second time visiting Tokyo, and I still feel like I am not close to visiting every part of the city. The Shibuya scramble never gets old.
